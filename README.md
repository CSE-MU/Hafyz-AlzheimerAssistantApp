## Hafyz - Smart Android App and it targets Alzheimer's Disease Patients!

## The App will have three features:

### 1- Face recognition
In this feature, we will use machine learning and computer vision to build a face recognizer, that help AD patient to recognize their family members that they forgot frequently!
This feature will use a mobile camera to recognize people in the images and people in front of the patient directly!   

### 2- Memory & Attention
This the second feature, it will be the big part! We will use the attention mechanism in deep learning and memory storage to record what patients say and people around them say, the App will record all this speech data and convert it to text, in this phase we will use Natural Language Processing to analyze text and extract useful information such as events and some advice from their Doctor for time of treatments and time of exercises .. etc, then it convert important things to voice and tell the patient about important events!

### 3- GPS Tracking
In this feature, we will build a GPS tracker to track patient in their walks and record the pathway to help them know how to return home in case they forgot the way, also it will notify their family where is he/she in case they lost!
